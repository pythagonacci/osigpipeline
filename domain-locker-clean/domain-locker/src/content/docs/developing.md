## App Setup

### Development Environment

```
git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/domain-locker.git
cd domain-locker
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

To build for production, use `npm run build`, then `npm start`.
Or to build for a particular platform, use the `build:vercel`, `build:netlify` commands.

## Database Setup

While running in dev, you will be automatically connected to our public development Supabase instance,
so there is no need to setup or configure a database. (Note that the dev database is frequently wiped).

Alternatively, you can deploy your own database, either a (self-hosted or Pro) Supabase instance or a Postgres database.

### Option 1) Postgres

With Postgres, follow the setup instructions in [Postgres Setup](/about/developing/postgres-setup),
then init the schema and start the DB with `./db/setup-postgres.sh`
(to import the [`schema.sql`](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/db/schema.sql)).
You'll then just need to pass the following env vars to the app, so it can connect to your Postgres instance.

```
DL_PG_HOST='localhost'
DL_PG_PORT='5432'
DL_PG_USER='postgres'
DL_PG_PASSWORD='supersecret'
DL_PG_NAME='domain_locker'
```

### Option 2) Supabase

Deploy a new Supabase instance, apply the config from [dl-sb-iac](https://github.com/Lissy93/dl-sb-iac) and set the following environmental variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL=xxx
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xx
```

The schema can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/db/schema.sql).

## Architecture

<div class="screenshots-wrap">
<img src="/articles/domain-locker-arch-self-hosted.png" >

</div>

### Self-Hosted Version

The self-hosted app is very simple, and consists of 3 containers:
- The app itself (client, server and optional webhooks for notifications)
- A Postgres database (to store your data)
- A cron service (optional, to keep domains up-to-date and trigger notifications)

### Managed Version

This differs slightly from the managed instance, which has the same core web app, but is reliant upon some non-free services for extra features and security.

Why the difference? Running a SaaS app requires some additional components/layers in order to offer users the best possible experience. For example, the managed app also needs to cover the following areas:
- Multiple environments, automated CI/CD
- An ORM between client and server
- Feature flagging and role-based features
- Domain name, DNS, Captcha, WAF, cache, SSL
- Billing and user plan management
- Authentication, authorization and SSO
- STMP mailer service, and Twilio SMS
- Notification channels for WhatsApp, SMS, Signal, etc
- Backups for database, config, logs, assets
- Observability for bugs, payments, availability, traces
- User support for queries, billing, bugs, feedback, etc

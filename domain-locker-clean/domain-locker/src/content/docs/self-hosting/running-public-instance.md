While you're free to do as you please on private self-hosted instances, if you intend to deploy a public instance of Domain Locker, there are some etiquette guidelines that we'd appreciate you try and follow.

#### Do
- ✅ Fork the repo (instead of copying it, or using our repo directly)
- ✅ Keep the original MIT license, and credit the original authors
- ✅ Take responsibility for securing your instance and protecting user data
- ✅ Make it clear to your users that your version is an independent fork and not affiliated with the original project
- ✅ Consider contributing back improvements, fixes, or features that could benefit the upstream project
- ✅ Have fun, and use Domain Locker for something cool!

#### Don't
- ❌ Don't charge for your service if you have deployed the code as-is (aka without substantial changes)
- ❌ Don't use our hosted APIs (they may be subject to change, rate limiting and auth)- run your own
- ❌ Don't expect unpaid support from the original authors for your own instance
- ❌ Don't misrepresent your fork as the official Domain Locker—your branding and domain should reflect that it's an independent instance
- ❌ Don't modify and redistribute under a more restrictive license—the MIT license ensures continued freedom to modify and share
- ❌ Don't use any of Domain Locker's code for illegal or unethical purposes
- ❌ And, pretty please - don't sue us

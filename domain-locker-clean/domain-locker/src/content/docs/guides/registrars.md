### What is a Registrar?

A **registrar** is the company you used (or your website provider used) to register your domain name - essentially, they manage your ownership of the domain.

You might of heard of registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or IONOS. These companies are responsible for maintaining the database of domain names and their associated owners. If you've ever paid to "buy" a domain, you probably did so through a registrar.

When you register a domain, you’re not actually buying it outright. Instead, you’re leasing it for a period of time (usually one year) from the registrar.

Each registrar is accredited and authorised to sell domain names by a central registry. For example, for `.com` domains, that registry is called *Verisign*.

### Why Track Your Registrars?

It’s useful to know which registrar your domain is registered with for several reasons:

- **Renewal Notices**: Domains are renewed yearly. Missing a renewal notice could lead to your site going offline - or worse, losing the domain entirely.
- **Pricing**: Some registrars charge more than others for renewals, privacy, or transfers. Keeping track helps you spot opportunities to save money.
- **Support and Access**: If you need to change your DNS settings, transfer your domain, or get support, you'll need to know which registrar to log in to.

If you manage several domains - especially registered at different times or by different team members - it’s easy to lose track. Domain Locker helps by keeping everything in one place.

### Registrars on Domain Locker

When you add a domain, we automatically detect its current registrar based on public records.

You can see all your registrars by going to [**/assets/registrars**](/assets/registrars). For each registrar, you’ll be able to:

- View which domains are registered through them
- See total domain count
- Compare expiry dates
- Identify any domains coming up for renewal soon
- Export or filter your registrar data if needed

This makes it much easier to stay organised, especially if your domains are spread across different providers.

### Can I Edit Registrar Info?

Because registrar data is automatically fetched from public records, it’s **not editable**. If your registrar appears incorrect, it likely means the public WHOIS record is out of date or the domain has recently changed hands. We’ll automatically re-check this from time to time.

### Quick Tips

- Always keep your registrar account details safe and accessible  
- Enable **auto-renew** on important domains  
- Use privacy protection (often included for free) to hide your personal info  
- Keep an eye on **renewal costs** - some registrars increase fees after the first year

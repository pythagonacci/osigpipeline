### What do we mean by domain?

This is typically the URL of your website, such as example.com.

A domain needs to be registered or purchased through a registrar. If you used a website builder, they will have registered it on your behalf.

Once registered, it will be pointed to wherever you are hosting your website using DNS records. Again, if you used a website builder this will have been done automatically for you.

### Adding a Domain on Domain Locker
When you first launch Domain Locker, you'll be prompted to add your first domain. You can always edit/remove it, as well as adding more later.

Adding is as simple as pasting the URL and clicking add. You don't have to add anything to your website, verify anything, or change any settings. Everything we do uses public read-only data about your website. Your domain will not be modified in anyway.

When you save a domain name, we will automatically fetch all associated data about in the background; this might take up to 30 seconds to appear.

Once your websites are added, you'll then be able to see a portfolio of all your domains on your homepage. You'll also see key data about the domain; like registrar and expiry- you can change which info is visible with the "Visible Fields" dropdown.

Clicking a domain will take you to it's full page. Here's you'll be able to see all data associated with that domain. Most of this data is auto-fetched, and will be kept up-to-date by us automatically.

#### Viewing
To view info about a domain, click the domain name. This will take you to `/domains/[domain]`. Here you will be able to see all the data available for your domain. We'll go into what this data means in a later section.

There are several other views, such as [stats](/stats) where you can view analytics about your domain, and [assets](/assets) where you can see all auto-fetched domain assets

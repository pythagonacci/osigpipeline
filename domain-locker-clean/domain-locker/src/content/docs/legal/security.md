description: Our practices for safeguarding data and handling vulnerabilities

At **Domain Locker**, protecting your data is one of our highest priorities. We employ robust security measures to safeguard your information and ensure the integrity of our platform. This policy outlines our security practices and how we handle vulnerabilities.

## Security Practices
### 1. **Data Encryption**
- All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.  
- Sensitive data, such as passwords, is securely hashed and never stored in plaintext.  

### 2. **Access Controls**
- Role-based access controls restrict data access to authorized personnel only.  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for administrative accounts.

### 3. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**
- We perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.  
- Continuous monitoring of the platform ensures early detection of potential issues.  

### 4. **Third-Party Services**
- Our third-party providers (e.g., Supabase, Cloudflare, Stripe) are chosen for their high-security standards and GDPR compliance.

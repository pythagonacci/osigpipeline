At **Domain Locker**, your privacy is not just important—it’s a core principle that shapes everything we do. We believe that your data is yours, and we work tirelessly to ensure it is treated with the utmost respect. 

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information. Domain Locker is created by Alicia Sykes of **AS93.net**, based in the UK, and adheres to a privacy-first philosophy in line with all our apps and services.

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests about your privacy, we’re here to help. Contact us at `privacy at as93 dot net`.

## What Data We Collect
To provide our services, we collect and store the following information:
- **Account Information**: Your email and password (encrypted and never stored in plaintext). If you sign up using Google or GitHub, we may also access your profile picture.
- **Optional Profile Details**: Name, profile picture, or other information you choose to provide.
- **Domain Data**: When you add a domain, we store the domain name and use public data to fetch related assets like registrars, IP addresses, SSL certificates, DNS records, subdomains, security statuses, and more. You can also optionally add tags, notes, or links to domains.
- **Local Preferences**: Your language, theme, and accessibility preferences, stored locally in your browser.

## How We Use Your Data
We use the data we collect to provide the services you expect:
- Managing and monitoring your domain portfolio.
- Alerting you to important domain changes (e.g., expirations or configuration updates).
- Storing your preferences for a personalized experience.
We **never use your data for marketing communications** unless you explicitly opt in, and we do not sell or share your data with third parties.

---

## Data Storage and Security
We use trusted third-party providers to deliver our services securely:
- **Cloudflare** for hosting.
- **Supabase** for authentication.
- **Stripe** for processing payments.

Your data is stored securely, and we use encryption and access controls to protect it. All passwords are encrypted, and sensitive data is safeguarded with industry best practices.

## Data Sharing
We do not share your data with any third parties except those required to operate our services (e.g., Supabase, Stripe). These providers comply with strict privacy standards. **We will never sell your data** or share it for advertising purposes.

---

## Cookies and Tracking
Domain Locker does not use cookies. However, we store an authentication token and temporary preferences (like language and theme) in your browser’s local storage. No tracking data is collected directly by us, although providers like Cloudflare may process some basic usage data for performance optimization.

---

## User Rights
We believe in giving you control over your data:
- **Access**: You can export your data anytime from within the app.
- **Deletion**: You can delete your account and all associated data at any time.
- **Transparency**: Domain Locker is fully open source, so you can verify every privacy claim we make.

## Children’s Privacy
Domain Locker is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.

## Changes to This Policy
If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify users by displaying a clear notification within the app.

## Our Privacy Commitment
Privacy is at the heart of Domain Locker and everything we build. This app was designed with privacy-first principles, ensuring that you are in full control of your data. 

Domain Locker is created by Alicia Sykes, who has authored **privacy-focused tools and resources**, including [Awesome Privacy](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy) and self-hosted apps that empower users to escape big tech and vendor lock-in. Our commitment to privacy is genuine, not just a checkbox. **We don’t just respect your privacy—we advocate for it.**

If you prefer to self-host Domain Locker to have complete control of your data, the option is available to you. Our open-source approach ensures transparency and trust.

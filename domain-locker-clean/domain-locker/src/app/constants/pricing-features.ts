      We offer a smaller Hobby plan at an affordable price, as well as a discount for paying annually instead of monthly.
      And since the code is open source, you can also run Domain Locker locally for free.\n
      If you're a student, open-source maintainer, residing in a low income country, or cannot otherwise afford a paid plan,
      then reach out and I will try and help you out :)

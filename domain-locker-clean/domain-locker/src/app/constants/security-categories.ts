// This file lists the categories that are used to classify the security status of domains

// EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol) status codes show sec and opp statuses of domains
// Client codes are set by registrars, server codes are set by registries and take precedence
// The standardized EPP codes are defined in STD-69 and the additional RGP codes in RFC-3915

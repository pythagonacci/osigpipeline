## About

The aim of Domain Locker, is to give you complete visibility of your domain name portfolio, in once central place.

For each domain you add, we analyse it and fetch all associated data. We then continuously monitor your domains, and notify you (according to your preferences) when something important changes or when it's soon to expire. So you'll get detailed domain analysis, security insights, change history, recent performance, valuation data and much more.

With Domain Locker, you'll never again loose track of your domains, miss an expiration, or forget which registrar and providers each domain uses.

### Demo

Try the live demo to [demo.domain-locker.com](https://demo.domain-locker.com) <br>
(Username: `demo@domain-locker.com` Password: `domainlocker`)

---

## Get Started

To use Domain Locker, you have two options:
1. 💻 The managed instance, at **[domain-locker.com](https://domain-locker.com/)** _(free)_
2. 🏗️ Or **[self-hosting](#deployment)** yourself via Docker _(also free, ofc!)_

### Option 1: Domain-Locker.com
Head to [our website](https://domain-locker.com), and sign up with Google, GitHub or your email.<br>
The starter plan is free, and no setup is required. Just sign in, add your domains, and start tracking them.

### Option 2: Self-Hosting

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.domain-locker.com | bash
```

Use the one-liner abover, or use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

<details>
	<summary>Details</summary>

 
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Domain Locker is intended to be run in a container, so you'll need Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your host system.
- **Containers**:
  - We have a Docker image published to [`lissy93/domain-locker`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lissy93/domain-locker).
  - You'll also need a Postgres database, such as the [`postgres:15-alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres?tab=tags&name=15-alpine) container.
- **Environment**:
  - When starting the container, bind `3000` in the container, to your host `PORT` (defaults to `3000`).
  - Then specify the Postgres vars: `DL_PG_HOST`, `DL_PG_PORT`, `DL_PG_USER`, `DL_PG_PASSWORD` and `DL_PG_NAME`.
- **Volumes**:
  - Mount a volume to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to persist your Postgres data
- **Crons**
  - `/api/domain-updater` - Execute this daily, to keep domain data up-to-date and trigger notifications
  - `/api/uptime-monitor` - Execute this every N minutes, to monitor website uptime and performance
- **Example**:
  - Putting it all together, you can use our [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.
  - For more details, view the [Self-Hosting Docs](https://domain-locker.com/about/self-hosting)

## Developing

#### Project Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/domain-locker.git    # Get the code
cd domain-locker                                      # Navigate into directory
npm install --legacy-peer-deps                        # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env                                  # Set environmental variables
npm run dev                                           # Start the dev server
```

- **Prerequisites**
  - You'll need Git and Node installed on your system.
- **Configuring**
  - The example `.env.sample` file includes the public creds for our Supabase dev instance
  - To use alternate db, see the [Database](#database) section below to configure with Postgres
- **Deploying**
  - You can build with code with `npm run build`, then run with `npm start`
  - Or, with Docker building the container with `docker build -t domain-locker .`
  - Don't use the dev Supabase instance in prod, as it's frequently wiped

---

## App Architecture

#### Tech Stack

Domain Locker is made up of an app, database and some API endpoints.
- **The app** is built with Angular, using Analog+Nitro with PrimeNg components, and Tailwind for styling
- **The server** is a series of Deno endpoints with Typescript functions
- **The database** can be either Postgres or Supabase

While the self-hosted instance is intended to be deployed stand-alone, the managed version however depends on a few additional third-party services, which you can see below, [the docs of which are here](https://domain-locker.com/about/developing/third-party-docs).

<details>
<summary>Why</summary>
Why Angular? As some sort of sick joke to future me, who then needs to maintain this.
</details>


<p align="center">
<img width="800" src="/.github/screenshots/architecture.png" />
<br>
<span>You can view docs for the technologies and services used <a href="https://domain-locker.com/about/developing/third-party-docs">here</a></span>
</p>


#### Architecture

The architecture is pretty simple.
We have an app (consisting of a frontend and API endpoints), where the user can read and write to the database (through adapters). Then a cron service will periodically call API endpoints to keep domain data up-to-date, track changes, monitor health, and trigger notifications on certain changes (according to user preference) or before an upcoming expiration.

    end

    Database -->|Serve Data| WebApp;
```

#### Database

A database is needed to store all your domains and associated info.
Domain Locker supports both Supabase and standard Postgres for storing data.
The db used will depend on which env vars are set.

- **Supabase**: Follow the Supabase [self-hosting docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting), then use [dl-sb-iac](https://github.com/lissy93/dl-sb-iac) to import the schema and configure auth, edge functions, emails, etc.
	- Then set: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environmental variables
- **Postgres**: Deploy a Postgres instance, then use our [`setup-postgres.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/db/setup-postgres.sh) script to init your DB with our[`schema.sql`](https://github.com/Lissy93/domain-locker/blob/main/db/schema.sql)
	- Then set: `DL_PG_HOST`, `DL_PG_PORT`, `DL_PG_USER`, `DL_PG_PASSWORD`, `DL_PG_NAME`

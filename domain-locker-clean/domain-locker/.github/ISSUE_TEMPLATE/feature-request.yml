      ðŸ™Œ Thanks for your suggestion! While I can't guarantee every feature will
      be implemented â€” especially if it's highly specific â€” I will carefully
      consider all ideas and prioritize those that benefit the wider community.<br><br>
      If you're keen to contribute or prototype the idea yourself, check out our
      [developer docs](https://domain-locker.com/about/developing) - PRs are always welcome!
